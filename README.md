🔥 **Contrastive Language Models (CLMs)** are a new class of **System One
model** trained with a **contrastive learning** objective that connects
**states and actions**. This repo serves **CLM-8B** behind a
TypeSafe-compatible API.

- **CLM-8B** is pre-trained on **60M Nemotron Q&A pairs**, mid-trained on
  **30M synthetic hard negatives**, and post-trained on **1M agentic
  trajectories**.
- It performs on par with **Jev** across computer-use, gaming and tool-calling
  tasks with up to **9× lower latency**. With lightweight fine-tuning it sets a
  new SOTA as a verifier on agentic coding benchmarks: **Terminal-Bench 2.1
  (87.6%)** and **DeepSWE (81.6%)**.
- **States and actions are disaggregated**, so their embeddings are cached and
  reused independently, which makes training and serving cheap and blazing fast!

We invite the community to plug it into their own agents and benchmarks!

## Installation

```bash
pip install contrastive-lm
```

To install the latest from a clone:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Run in Docker (one container, GPU)

For a self-contained deployment that launches both `vllm` (Qwen3-8B
pooling encoder) and `clm-serve` inside a single image, see
[`docker/README.md`](docker/README.md).

**NVIDIA / CUDA host** (default image, `vllm/vllm-openai:latest`):
```bash
docker build -t clm-serve:latest .
docker run --rm -d --name clm \
    --gpus all --ipc=host \
    -p 8700:8700 -p 8090:8090 \
    -v clm-models:/models \
    -v clm-logs:/logs \
    clm-serve:latest
# playground: http://localhost:8700/
```

**AMD Instinct MI50 / MI60 / Radeon VII (gfx906)** — uses the
[`aiinfos/vllm-gfx906-mobydick`](https://github.com/v-aleks/vllm-gfx906-mobydick)
fork of vLLM:
```bash
docker build \
    --build-arg VLLM_IMAGE=aiinfos/vllm-gfx906-mobydick:latest \
    -t clm-serve-rocm:latest .
docker run --rm -d --name clm \
    --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri \
    --group-add video --group-add render \
    --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN --ipc=host \
    -p 8700:8700 -p 8090:8090 \
    -v clm-models:/models \
    -v clm-logs:/logs \
    clm-serve-rocm:latest
# playground: http://localhost:8700/
```

## Quickstart

### Serve

```bash
# 1. encoder (Qwen3-8B embeddings)
#    On AMD gfx906 the dtype flag is REQUIRED — bfloat16 is not native there
#    and would silently fall back to float32.
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B \
    --served-model-name qwen3-8b --runner pooling \
    --dtype float16 --max-model-len 2048 --port 8090 &

# 2. CLM API on :8700 (downloads the 75 MB reference head on first run)
clm-serve
```

States longer than 2048 tokens are truncated. For longer states, raise both limits
together, e.g. `--max-model-len 8192` on `vllm serve` and `clm-serve --max-tokens 8192`
(needs more GPU memory).

### Ask typed questions about a state

```python
from clm import CLMClient, Choice, Noul, Score

client = CLMClient()                          # CLM_BASE_URL (default http://127.0.0.1:8700), CLM_API_KEY
r = client.system_one(
    state="Customer: my invoice was charged twice and nobody answers the phone!",
    questions={
        "urgency": Noul(instructions="Is this urgent?"),
        "department": Choice(instructions="Which team should handle this?",
                             criteria={"billing": "Charges, invoices, refunds",
                                       "technical": "Bugs and outages"}),
        "frustration": Score(instructions="How frustrated is the customer?",
                             criteria=["Calm", "Frustrated", "Very angry"]),
    },
)
print(r.answers["urgency"].noul)                # 0.41022     probability the statement is true
print(r.answers["department"].choice)           # billing
print(r.answers["department"].probabilities)    # {'billing': 0.93878, 'technical': 0.06122}
print(r.answers["frustration"].score)           # 1.98386     expected level, 0..2
print(r.usage.input_tokens, r.latency_ms)       # 38 58.1     (106 tokens on a cold cache: option texts are embedded once)
```

Questions may be `Noul` / `Choice` / `Score` objects or plain wire-format
dicts, so a request written for TypeSafe replays as
`client.system_one(state, questions)`.

### Rank candidates directly

`system_one` is built on one primitive: score a candidate against a state.
For free-form candidates (best-of-N answers, tool names, next moves) use the
in-process engine's `rank`:

```python
from clm import Engine

engine = Engine(emb_url="http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/embeddings")     # reference head, downloaded if missing
engine.rank("What causes tides on Earth?",
            ["The Moon's gravitational pull.", "Photosynthesis in plants.", "Because the Earth is round."])
# [{'rank': 1, 'candidate': "The Moon's gravitational pull.", 'prob': 0.997}, ...]

engine.answer(state, questions)      # the same dict the HTTP endpoint returns, no server needed
```

---

## Playground

`clm-serve` also serves a web UI at `/` (`http://localhost:8700/` by default).
Write a state, add typed questions, and see CLM's answer distributions; every
request is also shown as JSON, `curl` and Python. A **Rank** tab ranks any
candidate set, and links are shareable.

## Results

### Zero-shot evaluation

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Zero-shot latency and success rate, CLM-8B vs Jev, on T-Rex, BFCL v4 tool calling, WikiRacing and Super Mario" src="assets/zero-shot.png" width=100%>
</p>

Across **computer-use, gaming and tool-calling tasks**, CLM-8B performs on par
with Jev while running **up to 9× faster**. The speedups are largest when the
number of candidate actions is large (WikiRacing) or when actions are reused
across states (the T-Rex game). The T-Rex benchmark ships in this repo:
see [examples/t_rex](examples/t_rex/README.md).

### Agentic benchmarks: CLM as a verifier

<p align="center">
  <img alt="DeepSWE and Terminal-Bench 2.1: success rate and verifier latency, CLM vs Jev" src="assets/agentic.png" width=100%>
</p>

For each task we sample several candidate solutions (**Opus 5** for DeepSWE,
**Fable 5** for Terminal-Bench 2.1), and CLM or Jev acts as the verifier that
picks the best one. Evaluated on **38 held-out DeepSWE tasks** and **30
held-out Terminal-Bench 2.1 tasks**; latency on an H100. Jev fails to serve as
a verifier for these long-horizon tasks, scoring below pass@1. With lightweight
fine-tuning, CLM reaches SOTA on both (**81.6%** and **87.6%**) while running
**4.1–5.7× faster than Jev**.

## How it works

### About

CLM first trains a **state encoder** and an **action encoder** on a
large-scale dataset with a contrastive objective (InfoNCE), so that each state
is pulled toward the ground-truth action that was taken and pushed away from
all others. The two encoders then serve directly as a zero-shot action
classifier: at deployment, given the current state and a set of candidate
actions, CLM scores each action by how well its embedding aligns with the
state embedding and selects the highest-scoring action.

That is what this package serves. A typed question is a state plus a closed
set of candidate actions (the options and their descriptions); a softmax over
CLM's scores *is* the answer distribution, and the same call ranks best-of-N
trajectories, routes tools, shortlists retrieval pools and answers typed
decisions with no per-task setup.

**Architecture, data recipe and scaling laws:**

- Each encoder is a frozen LLM backbone plus a 20M-parameter trainable
  projection head, so inference is one
  embedding per fresh text and a dot product per cached candidate.
- CLM is **pre-trained** on internet-scale Q&A, **mid-trained** on synthetic
  hard negatives, **post-trained** on agentic traces, and can be easily
  fine-tuned on downstream tasks ([data recipe](#data-recipe)).
- The InfoNCE loss **decreases predictably as a power law** in training
  compute, model size and dataset size ([details](#scaling-laws-for-verification)).

```
browser ──► clm-serve  (CPU, :8700)   GET / (playground)
client  ──►                          POST /v1/systemone · GET /v1/models · GET /health
               │       state head + action head (20M params, hot-reloaded), embedding cache
               ▼
          vLLM Qwen3-8B pooling server (GPU, :8090)   /v1/embeddings
```

### Training Algorithm

CLM is trained with a bidirectional InfoNCE loss. Given a batch of $B$
matched state–action pairs, we compute a $B \times B$ similarity matrix and,
for each positive pair $(s_i, a_i)$, optimize retrieval in both directions
($s_i \rightarrow a_i$ and $a_i \rightarrow s_i$):

```math
L_{\mathrm{CLM}} = -\frac{1}{2B}\sum_i \left[ \log \frac{\exp\left(s_i^\top a_i/\tau\right)} {\sum_j \exp\left(s_i^\top a_j/\tau\right)} + \log \frac{\exp\left(a_i^\top s_i/\tau\right)} {\sum_j \exp\left(a_i^\top s_j/\tau\right)} \right]
```

For mid-training, the objective is extended with hard negatives. Let
$h_{ik}^{(a)}$ denote a hard negative action for state $s_i$; the
state-to-action direction becomes

```math
L_{s \rightarrow a}^{\mathrm{hard}}=-\frac{1}{B}\sum_i\log\frac{\exp\left(s_i^\top a_i / \tau\right)}{\exp\left(s_i^\top a_i / \tau\right)+\sum_k\exp\left(s_i^\top h_{ik}^{(a)} / \tau\right)}.
```

### Scaling Laws for Verification

The test InfoNCE loss $L$ scales as a power law with training compute $C$,
dataset size $D$, projection-head size $N$ and encoder size
$N_{\mathrm{enc}}$. These dimensions must be scaled jointly for the best
verification performance; when a scale factor is not bottlenecked by the
others, the dependence on each variable $`X \in \{C, D, N, N_{\mathrm{enc}}\}`$
is

```math
L(X) \approx \left(\frac{X_c}{X}\right)^{\alpha_X},
```

where $X_c$ is a fitted scale constant and $\alpha_X$ the corresponding
scaling exponent, following Kaplan et al. Scaling the encoder size yields the
strongest gains. Experiments are conducted on the Nemotron DQA dataset and
evaluated on a held-out set; the fits and figures are in the
[blog post](https://contrastive-lm.notion.site).

**Data vs. optimal model size.** At a fixed compute budget, each iso-FLOP
curve of test loss against head size is well approximated by a parabola in
log-parameter space, and its minimum gives the optimal head size for that data
budget. The optimum grows almost exactly linearly with the number of training
tokens, $N^* \propto D^{1.02}$, at roughly **310 tokens per parameter**.

### Data Recipe

CLM is trained in three stages, each a progressively harder form of
state–action alignment:

1. **Pre-training** on **~60M Nemotron DQA question–answer pairs**, each
   question the state and its answer the action. This learns broad semantic
   representations.
2. **Mid-training** on **~30M synthetic hard negatives** generated by Gemini
   2.5 Flash-Lite: semantically similar but incorrect answers to Nemotron DQA
   questions, added to the InfoNCE loss as above. This develops fine-grained
   discrimination between plausible actions.
3. **Post-training** on **~1M agent trajectories** from the Agent Data
   Protocol (ADP) dataset, plus terminal traces from Endless-Terminals and
   LiteCoder-Terminal-SFT. Each trajectory step is a state–action pair: the
   agent's current context and the decision it took.

**Replay during post-training.** 40% of the post-training mixture is Nemotron
DQA replay and 60% agentic trajectories. With replay, Nemotron hard-negative
top-1 accuracy only moves from 69% to 68.5%; training on agentic data alone for
the same number of agentic steps drops it to 56.2%.

**Why not train on hard negatives from the start?** On ~100K held-out
questions (one gold answer, 10 hard negatives each), pre-training alone reaches
**52.1%** top-1 without seeing a hard negative, and a short mid-training stage
lifts it to **69.2%**. Training with hard negatives from the start improves
quickly but peaks at **62.4%** before overfitting, so the two-stage recipe is
**7 points better** at a fixed budget: hard negatives work best as a refinement
on top of pre-training, not a substitute for it.

The reference head served as `clm-latest` is
[Contrastive-LM/CLM-v0.1-8B](https://huggingface.co/Contrastive-LM/CLM-v0.1-8B)
(`CLM_v0.1-8B.pt`, Qwen3-8B backbone, last-token pooling). Any head in
the same checkpoint format — a `torch.save` dict with `state_head` /
`action_head` state dicts, `logit_scale` and `cfg` (`width`, `depth`,
`projection_dim`, `activation`, `layernorm`, `residual`) — can be served with
`--ckpt`; a head only makes sense with the encoder and pooling it was trained
against.

---

## Roadmap

1. **Scaling experiments:** larger backbones, and how far verification
   performance keeps scaling.
2. **Vision and multimodal support:** images, video and other modalities for
   robotics and computer-use tasks.
3. **Scaling the data recipe:** more pre-training, hard-negative mining and
   agentic post-training.

## API Reference

### `POST /v1/systemone`

| field | |
| --- | --- |
| `state` | string, object or array (objects are rendered as `key: value` text, arrays as `- item` lines; never JSON, the heads are trained on prose) |
| `model` | `clm-latest` (default), `clm-raw`, or any model from `GET /v1/models` |
| `questions` | `{id: Question}`, at least one |
| `temperature` | optional, `(0, 100]`, default 1; divides the logits before the softmax |

| question | required | answer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `noul` | `instructions`; optional `criteria: {"true": …, "false": …}` | `{"noul": p_true}` |
| `choice` | `instructions` (the question), `criteria: {option: description}` (each option is embedded as its description, or its key when the description is empty) | `{"choice", "confidence", "probabilities"}` |
| `score` | `instructions`, `criteria: [level0, level1, …]` (ordered, ≥2) | `{"score", "confidence", "legend", "probabilities"}` |

- `confidence` = top probability minus the mean of the others.
- `score` = expected level index; `legend` maps indices back to the rubric.
- `usage.input_tokens` counts encoder tokens spent on cache misses;
  `billing_units` is the number of questions.
- Errors: `401` bad key · `422` malformed request or unknown model · `502`
  embedder unreachable. `X-CLM-Latency-Ms` carries the server-side time.

### `POST /v1/rank`

The same primitive in its plain form: `{"context": ..., "question": ..., "answers": [...]}`
returns `{"model", "ranked": [{"rank", "candidate", "prob"}, ...]}`, best first. The
state head sees `context + question`, the action head sees each answer verbatim.
`CLMClient.rank(context, question, answers)` and `Engine.rank(context, answers, question)`
are the client and in-process forms.

### `GET /`

The playground (see [above](#playground)), unless `clm-serve --no-ui`. Static
files only; every API route above shadows it.

### `GET /v1/models`

```json
{"models": [{"name": "clm-latest", "description": "...", "release_date": "2026-09-19"},
            {"name": "clm-raw", "description": "Ablation: cosine in the raw encoder space", ...}]}
```

### `clm-serve` options

```
clm-serve [--port 8700] [--emb-url http://127.0.0.1:8090/v1/embeddings] [--emb-model qwen3-8b]
          [--max-tokens 2048] [--ckpt PATH] [--ckpt-dir DIR] [--model NAME=PATH ...] [--device cpu|cuda]
          [--action-cache 0.02|512MiB|0] [--no-ui] [--cors]
```

`--ckpt PATH` serves your own head as `clm-latest` (default: the reference
head in `~/.cache/clm/`, downloaded if missing); `--ckpt-dir DIR` serves every
`*.pt` there under its file stem; `--model NAME=PATH` adds one more.
The heads run on the GPU when torch sees one, else on the CPU; `--device` (or
`CLM_DEVICE`) forces one. Checkpoints hot-reload when the file changes. Set `CLM_API_KEY` to require
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` (the playground has a field for it). Environment
equivalents: `CLM_PORT`, `CLM_EMB_URL`, `CLM_EMB_MODEL`, `CLM_CKPT`,
`CLM_DEVICE`, `CLM_ACTION_CACHE`.

`--no-ui` drops the playground and serves the API alone. `--cors` allows browser
requests from any origin and is off by default, because an API key otherwise
travels in a header any page would then be free to send.

#### The vector cache

An agent asks about a changing state but a mostly fixed set of actions, and it
revisits states it has already seen. Neither their embeddings nor their
projections change while the head does not, so `clm-serve` reserves a slab of
device memory at start-up — the way vLLM claims its KV cache — and keeps them in
it:

```
[clm] vector cache 505.0 MB reserved on cuda (215,764x512d + 3,852x4096d)
```

`--action-cache` takes a fraction of the device (`0.02`, the default), an
absolute size (`512MiB`), or `0` to switch it off; `CLM_ACTION_CACHE` does the
same. It covers states and actions on every served head, and `clm-raw` in the
encoder's own space — the two widths are pools carved from the one allocation,
which never grows, so a long-running server cannot drift into an out-of-memory
kill. Entries are keyed by head and generation, so several heads share the arena
and a hot-reloaded head stops matching rows its previous weights produced;
eviction is least-recently-used. `GET /health` reports occupancy and hit rate.

A hit skips the encoder call, the host-to-device copy and the head's forward
pass. Measured on one RTX 4090, server-side p50, against a fixed action set:

| | 3 actions | 50 actions |
|---|---|---|
| new state every call | 28.6 → 28.0 ms | 28.8 → 28.1 ms |
| revisited states (20 rooms) | 1.7 → 0.6 ms | 2.0 → 0.7 ms |
| one repeated state | 1.7 → 0.6 ms | 2.0 → 0.7 ms |

So a loop that revisits states answers about 2.8x faster, and a loop that never
repeats itself pays the encoder either way. A cached vector costs no encoder
tokens, so `usage.input_tokens` counts only what the encoder actually did.
