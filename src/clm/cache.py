"""A reserved device arena for the vectors an agent loop keeps asking about again.

An agent asks about a changing state but a mostly fixed set of actions, and it
often revisits states it has already seen.  Neither their embeddings nor their
projections change while the head does not, so they are worth keeping next to the
head rather than recomputing (or copying from host) on every request.

The arena is claimed once at start-up, the way vLLM claims its KV cache: one flat
allocation whose size comes from a budget -- a fraction of the device's memory
(``0.02``), or an absolute size (``512MiB``).  Pools of different widths are
carved out of that one allocation (512-d projections for the heads, 4096-d
encoder embeddings for the raw ablation), so nothing grows afterwards and a
long-running server cannot drift into an out-of-memory kill.

Entries are keyed by a namespace and the text.  The namespace names the head and
its generation, so several served heads share one arena, and a head that
hot-reloads simply stops matching rows its previous weights produced;
least-recently-used eviction reclaims them.
